# Minimal example for building and testing Python wheels with CUDA code

This repository presents an end-to-end example for building and testing Python wheels with CUDA code.

## Locally build and test
To build the Python wheel, run:
```
python -m build -v --wheel
```

To run tests, run:
```
pip install dist/example-0.0.1-cp312-abi3-linux_x86_64.whl
pytest -v tests
```

## Workflow overviews
* **containers.yaml**: Build two Docker containers, to be used for building and testing the Python wheel.
  The Dockerfile definitions are found in the ``ci/`` subdirectory. Once the containers are built,
  they are pushed to the GitHub Packages registry.
  - ``cuda_test``: Ubuntu 24.04 based container, to be used for testing the wheel
* **main.yaml**: Performs the following steps in order.
  1. Build the Python wheel using [cibuildwheel](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel).
  3. Test the Python wheel, inside the ``cuda_test`` container.

## Next step: Configure GitHub organization settings
To enable GPU runners on GitHub Actions, you should consult the article
